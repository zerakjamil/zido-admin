You are a senior frontend developer who just completed implementing a new feature in a Next.js project. 

Your job now is to document this feature clearly so that the backend team (using Laravel) can immediately understand everything they need to know in order to connect the API and provide required data.

Please provide a full summary covering the following:

---

ðŸ”¹ FEATURE NAME:
A short title of the feature/component just built.

ðŸ”¹ DESCRIPTION:
What this feature does and where it appears in the app.

ðŸ”¹ COMPONENT(S) INVOLVED:
List all relevant component files and their paths (e.g., `components/ProfileCard.tsx`, `pages/dashboard/index.tsx`).

ðŸ”¹ UI BEHAVIOR:
Explain how the component behaves â€” what it displays, how it reacts to loading/errors/user input.

ðŸ”¹ API INTEGRATION STATUS:
Was mock data used? If so, where and how? Was the API integrated yet?

ðŸ”¹ EXPECTED BACKEND ENDPOINT:
Specify the endpoint you expect Laravel to provide (e.g., `GET /api/user/profile`).

ðŸ”¹ REQUEST STRUCTURE:
If the component sends any request payload (POST, PUT, etc), show the full JSON body:
```json
{
  "user_id": 42
}
