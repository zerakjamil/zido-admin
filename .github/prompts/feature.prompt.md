You are a senior frontend developer working on a production-grade Next.js + TypeScript + TailwindCSS application.

I want you to implement a full feature using mock data **with clean architecture** that allows easy replacement with a real API later.

### Please generate the following:

1. A reusable and styled component (React functional component)
2. A custom data fetching hook (`useXYZ`)
3. A service file (with mock API logic â€” `Promise.resolve(...)`)
4. A separate file for mock data
5. All TypeScript types and interfaces
6. Bonus: use loading, error, and empty state handling
7. All code should be split into appropriate folders like:
   `/components`, `/hooks`, `/services`, `/mock`
